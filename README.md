# Two Stop

This is a proof of concept image processor which uses a technique of sacrificing image resolution
for light/exposure. Two full stops of light can be gained (hence the name) at the cost of halving 
the resolution.

This could be helpful for astrophotography for example where saving 2 stops of light could mean the
diffence between a 30 sec exposure and a 2 min exposure.

Another use case could be to get very low noise images by shooting at ISO 100 and setting exposure 
compensation to -2 stops (or more if you boost in post).

You can view the output sample file [here](images/test.jpg).

## Set Up

The best way to set this up is with a `virtualenv` and installing the dependencies like so:

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venve/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example

This repo includes a sample NEF RAW file which was shot with exposure compensation set to -2 stops. You can run a 
test preview like so:

```
$ ./twostop.py preview images/test.nef
Reading RAW file images/test.nef.
Post processing RAW image preview.
Converting image from array.
Post processing RAW image.
Two stop processing.
```

You can produce a JPG like so:

```
$ ./twostop.py process images/test.nef
Reading RAW file images/test.nef.
Post processing RAW image.
Two stop processing.
Rendering to file images/test.jpg.
images/test.nef done.

Done, processed 1 images.
```

## Usage

NOTE This only works with RAW images, this will not work with raster images (JPGs/PNGs etc.).

### Process

Process one or more RAW image files and output to JPG.

```
$ ./twostop.py process images/test.nef images/test2.nef --expcomp=1.25
```

This will produce JPG images at `images/test.jpg` and `images/test2.jpg`.

#### Args

- `expcomp` - Exposure compensation. E.g. 0.25 = -2 stops, 8.0 = +3 stops

### Preview

Process a RAW image file and show a before/after preview + histogram.

```
$ ./twostop.py preview images/test.nef --expcomp=1.25
```

#### Args

- `file` - The RAW file to process and preview
- `expcomp` - Exposure compensation. E.g. 0.25 = -2 stops, 8.0 = +3 stops


## How doe this work?

It is really quite simple, we are adding together the luminosity of adjacent pixels to create a brighter image. We are taking
4 pixels, adding together the R G B channels of each pixel and producing a single output. This creates an image at 1/4 the 
resolution which is 4 times brighter (2 stops).

The below figure might help, 4 pixels becoming 1 ...


```
+--+--+--+
|10|24|          +--+--
+--+--+--   =>   |66|
| 9|23|          +--+-
+--+--+          |
|  |
+
```

Since this is just a proof of concept, we do this by a fixed integer amount making the code simple as possible. Halving the 
resolution which boosts exposure by 2 stops. You could do this by any amount if you used an intelligent downsampling algorithim. 

Additive downsampling is probably a good word for it.

One caveat of this is that it also boosts the contrast of the image. A way to fix this might be to only apply this additive downsampling
to the luminosity of the pixel (i.e. do a greyscale conversion), then apply that brightness value to the R G B channels separately.
